# RestApiTemplate-BlazorSample

The purpose of this repository is just for hosting via GitHub pages at [https://restapisample.jam-es.com](https://restapisample.jam-es.com). The code will not be useful to you.

It is a build of a Blazor WebAssembly sample app which uses my .NET Core 3.1 REST API Template which will be released open source in the next few months.

Some credit for deployment should be given to Rafael Pedicini as I followed his [guide for hosting Blazor WebAssembly apps on GitHub pages](https://dev.to/cirio/hosting-blazor-webassembly-app-on-github-pages-137k) (to fix routing issues).

Other credits and general info will be included in the source repository when it is released.
