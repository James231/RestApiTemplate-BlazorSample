# RestApiTemplate-BlazorSample

The purpose of this repository is just for hosting via GitHub pages at [https://restapisample.jam-es.com](https://restapisample.jam-es.com). The code will not be useful to you.

It is a build of a Blazor WebAssembly sample app which uses my .NET Core 3.1 REST API Template which will be released open source in the next few months.
